# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

    # https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3181

    # 'sphinx.ext.mathjax'

# to template names.

# Seen strictly one of both (the default is class) would suffice but a large part of our codebase has
# the docstring in __init__. While we are in the process of moving all documentation out of __init__ to
# the class level we instruct Sphinx to take it from both places.
